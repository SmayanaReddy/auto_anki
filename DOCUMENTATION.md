# Functionalities added to the older version:
- In the previous version, links were being extracted for the questions selected from the pdf, whereas we have added a feature where instead of links, we will be extracting answers to those questions. This will help the user get a compiled list of questions and answers.

- We integrated ANKI with the older version. 
  > ANKI: It is a program that creates flashcards which makes it easier to remember things.

  With the help of this, flashcards can be created for questions and answers.
  
 - Added logic for creating decks of the questions and answers collected.

 - In the previous version, user input was the lecture pdf but now the user has to enter the deck name.

 - Improved the code coverage from the previous version.

 - Updated the documentaion and README files.
