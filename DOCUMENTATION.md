# Functionalities added to the older version:
- In the previous version, links were being extracted for the questions selected from the pdf, whereas we have added a feature where instead of links, we will be extracting answers to those questions. This will help the user get a compiled list of questions and answers.

- We integrated ANKI with the older version. 
> ANKI: It is a program that creates flashcards which makes it easier to remember things.
