|.5| short release cycles|We had multiple releases, as well tested different components iteratively|
|.5| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...|minimum of x commits by each member|
|.5|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |Yes, animations, videos, motivation etc. Refer [README.md](https://github.com/usmanwardag/auto_anki#readme)|
|.5|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  |Guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/usmanwardag/auto_anki/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)|
|.5|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly  | in GH<todo>|
|.5|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | Everyone is using the same tools like Visual Studio Code for editing code files, github and git command line|
|.5|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |[Contributors](https://github.com/usmanwardag/auto_anki/graphs/contributors)|
|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |<todo><html functions> |
|.5|Number of commits: by different people  |[Commits per person](https://github.com/usmanwardag/auto_anki/pulse)>|
|1|issues are being closed |<link to closed issues>|
|.5|issues are discussed before they are closed | <closed issues comments>|
|.5|Use of syntax checkers. | Used Pylint, and ran Pylint Warning and Error checks as part of Travis CI|
|1|Issues reports: there are many  |<link to issues in repo>|

|.5|Use of style checkers | Used Pylint, and ran Pylint Warning and Error checks as part of Travis CI|
|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. |<todo in readme> |
|.5|test cases exist  | dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|
|.5|Use of code coverage  | Coverage badge using Codecov: <update link later>|
|.5|other automated analysis tools  | Pylint, CodeCoverage, Travis. Can check the status for the same through badges on homepage of repo<add link>|
